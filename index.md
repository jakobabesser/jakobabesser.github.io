excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a senior scientist at Fraunhofer IDMT with a focus on applied research in music information retrieval & machine listening applying techniques from machine learning / deep learning and audio signal processing.
Also, I have a big passion for playing & teaching music (bass guitar & percussion).

## News and Projects:

- Best paper award at the CMMR 2021 for our paper "Deep Learning-Based Music Instrument Recognition: Exploring Learned Feature Representations" (Michael Taenzer, Stylianos I. Mimilakis and Jakob Abeßer) (https://mobile.twitter.com/cmmr_2021/status/1461524710110334978)

- Two abstracts submitted to DAGA 2022: [Analyzing Bird and Bat Activity in Agricultural Environments using AI-driven Audio Monitoring](Abesser_2022_DAGA_1.pdf) (collaboration with Prof. Christoph Scherber, Dr. Svenja Bänsch, Xiaoyi Wang, and Hanna Lukashevich) and [Construction-sAIt: Multi-modal AI-driven technologies for construction site monitoring](Abesser_2022_DAGA_2.pdf) (collaboration with Dr. Alexander Loos and Prachi Sharma) 

- New pre-print published: [Towards Audio Domain Adaptation for Acoustic Scene Classification using Disentanglement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13586) (collaboration with Prof. Meinard Müller)

- *Machine Listening for Music and Sound Analysis* - 6-part lecture on audio signal processing & deep learning applied for music information retrieval (MIR) and environmental sound analysis (ESA). The lecture will be held for the second time this winter semester at the TU Ilmenau [Lecture Page](https://machinelistening.github.io/) and will be continuously extended in the upcoming years. 

- I'm a guest editor for the EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing (JASM) call: [Recent advances in computational sound scene analysis](https://asmp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/ssoundscene) (together with Emmanouil Benetos, Annamaria Mesaros, Wenwu Wang)

- *Groovecell* - online Learning Platform for Bass and Drums ([Project website](http://groovecell.de/), [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG_MYElsQmKc4AJ7ounTKmA), [Online Courses on Soundslice](https://www.soundslice.com/users/groovecell/courses/))
