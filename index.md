I am a post-doctoral researcher at Fraunhofer IDMT with a focus on applied research in music information retrieval & machine listening applying techniques from machine learning / deep learning and audio signal processing.
Also, I have a passion for playing & teaching music (bass guitar & percussion), photography, cooking, sport, and family.
