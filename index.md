excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a senior scientist at Fraunhofer IDMT with a focus on applied research in music information retrieval & machine listening applying techniques from machine learning / deep learning and audio signal processing.
Also, I have a passion for playing & teaching music (bass guitar & percussion), photography, cooking, sport, and my family.

## News and Projects:

- New pre-print published: [Towards Audio Domain Adaptation for Acoustic Scene Classification using Disentanglement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13586) (collaboration with Prof. Meinard MÃ¼ller)

- *Machine Listening for Music and Sound Analysis* - 6-part lecture on audio signal processing & deep learning applied for music information retrieval (MIR) and environmental sound analysis (ESA). The lecture will be held for the second time this winter semester at the TU Ilmenau [Lecture Page](https://machinelistening.github.io/) and will be continuously extended in the upcoming years. 

- *Groovecell* - online Learning Platform for Bass and Drums ([Project website](http://groovecell.de/), [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG_MYElsQmKc4AJ7ounTKmA), [Online Courses on Soundslice](https://www.soundslice.com/users/groovecell/courses/))
