excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a senior scientist at Fraunhofer IDMT with a focus on applied research in music information retrieval & machine listening applying techniques from machine learning / deep learning and audio signal processing.
Also, I have a big passion for playing & teaching music (bass guitar & percussion).

## Projects

- *Machine Listening for Music and Sound Analysis* - 6-part lecture on audio signal processing & deep learning applied for music information retrieval (MIR) and environmental sound analysis (ESA)
   - The lecture will be held for the second time this winter semester at the TU Ilmenau [Lecture Page](https://machinelistening.github.io/) and will be continuously extended in the upcoming years. 

- *Groovecell* - Online Learning for Bass and Drums 
   - [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG_MYElsQmKc4AJ7ounTKmA)
   - [Online Courses on Soundslice](https://www.soundslice.com/users/groovecell/courses/))

- *LMNT7* - Progressive Rock
   - [BandCamp](https://lmnt7.bandcamp.com/)
