excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a senior scientist at Fraunhofer IDMT with a focus on applied research in music information retrieval & machine listening and I'm currently working on my habilitation at the [TU Ilmenau](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de).

In my research, I combine techniques from machine learning / deep learning and audio signal processing.
On the "ambient sound" side, I work mostly on sound event detection, sound polyphony estimation, and acoustic scene classification and possible applications for urban sound monitoring and bioacoustic research.
One the "music" side, I'm mostly interested in automatic music transcription and instrument recognition.

Besides my research, I have a big passion for playing & teaching music (bass guitar & percussion).
