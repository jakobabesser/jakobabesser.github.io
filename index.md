excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a senior scientist at Fraunhofer IDMT with a focus on applied research in music information retrieval & machine listening applying techniques from machine learning / deep learning and audio signal processing.
Also, I have a big passion for playing & teaching music (bass guitar & percussion).
