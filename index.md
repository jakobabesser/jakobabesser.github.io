excerpt: "About Me..."
---

💼 I am a senior scientist and principal investigator at [Fraunhofer IDMT](https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/) with a focus on applied research in music information retrieval & machine listening.

🎓 I'm currently working on my habilitation **Computational Analysis of Sounds and Music** at the [TU Ilmenau](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de).

🔬 In my research, I combine techniques from machine learning / deep learning and audio signal processing. I mainly focus on two application scenarios:
  
  - **Environmental Sound Analysis** - Here, I work mostly on sound event detection, sound polyphony estimation, acoustic scene classification, and applications for urban sound monitoring and bioacoustic research.
  
  - **Music Information Retrieval** - Here, I'm mostly interested in automatic music transcription and instrument recognition.

## 👨‍🏫 Teaching

As a central part of my habilitation, I'm active in university teaching:

  - **Computational Analysis of Sound and Music** - Full semester lecture at TU Ilmenau to be first held in the summer semester 2024, which will cover fundamentals in audio signal processing and machine/deep learning, application scenarios in music information retrieval and environmental sound analysis, as well as a practical research project (contact me if you're interest in participating!)

  - **Machine Listening for Music and Sound Analysis** - 6-part lecture on audio signal processing & deep learning applied for music information retrieval (MIR) and environmental sound analysis (ESA). The lecture took place for the fifth time in the winter semester 2023/2024 at the TU Ilmenau. The lecture & seminar material can be found on the [Lecture Page](https://machinelistening.github.io/).

  - **KI-gestützte Audioanalyse von Musik und Soundscapes** - Bi-weekly seminar held in the winter semester 2022/2023 at the [HfM Weimar](https://www.hfm-weimar.de) in cooperation with [Prof. Martin Pfleiderer](https://www.hfm-weimar.de/institut-fuer-musikwissenschaft-weimar-jena/lehrende/professorinnen). The lecture material can be found on the [Lecture Page](https://machinelistening.github.io/).

## 🎸 🥁 🎧 Music

I have a big passion for playing & teaching music (bass guitar & percussion).
